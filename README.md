### Project 1:  [Analysis of access to healthcare among seniors](https://github.com/paulamiguha/pg_master/tree/main/Academic_Projects/Research%20Methods)

**Abstract**
  
Utilization of health care services varies across the seniors who are aged 65 and above. This paper tries to examine the problem of access to health services in terms of trouble finding a doctor. Using binary logistic regression, the paper investigates the effects of sociodemographic, economic status, type of insurance coverage and health status of the seniors on their access to health care.

The main findings of the paper show that seniors who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans have trouble finding a doctor. Elderly people who are residing in west region also have problem to get medical provider. Seniors who are male have less problem to access health services. Thus, the implication of policymakers is to ensure better access to health services among seniors
